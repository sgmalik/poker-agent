			"difficulty": "beginner",
			"topic": "preflop",
			"question": "You're UTG with AA in a 6-max cash game. What's your action?",
			"scenario": {
				"hero_hand": "As Ad",
				"position": "UTG",
				"action_to_hero": "first_to_act",
				"stack_depth": "100bb"
			},
			"options": [
				"Fold",
				"Limp",
				"Raise 2.5bb",
				"Raise 4bb"
			],
			"answer": "Raise 2.5bb",
			"explanation": "AA is the strongest starting hand. From UTG, you should raise to 2.5-3bb to build the pot while keeping worse hands in. Limping risks giving free cards to speculative hands, and raising too large telegraphs strength and may fold out hands you dominate."
		},
		{
			"id": "pf_002",
			"type": "preflop_action",
			"difficulty": "beginner",
			"topic": "preflop",
			"question": "You're on the BTN with AKs. UTG raises to 3bb. What's your action?",
			"scenario": {
				"hero_hand": "As Ks",
				"position": "BTN",
				"action_to_hero": "raise_3bb",
				"stack_depth": "100bb"
			},
			"options": [
				"Fold",
				"Call",
				"3-bet to 9bb",
				"3-bet to 15bb"
			],
			"answer": "3-bet to 9bb",
			"explanation": "AKs is a premium hand that should be 3-bet for value against an UTG raise. A standard 3-bet size is 3x the original raise when in position. This builds the pot with a strong hand and allows you to realize equity with position postflop."
		},
		{
			"id": "pf_003",
			"type": "preflop_action",
			"difficulty": "beginner",
			"topic": "preflop",
			"question": "You're UTG with 72o. What's your action?",
			"scenario": {
				"hero_hand": "7s 2c",
				"position": "UTG",
				"action_to_hero": "first_to_act",
				"stack_depth": "100bb"
			},
			"options": [
				"Fold",
				"Limp",
				"Raise 2.5bb"
			],
			"answer": "Fold",
			"explanation": "72o is statistically the worst starting hand in poker, with poor equity against any reasonable range. From UTG with 8 players behind, this hand has negative expected value and should be folded immediately."
		},
		{
			"id": "pf_004",
			"type": "preflop_action",
			"difficulty": "beginner",
			"topic": "preflop",
			"question": "You're in the CO with AJo. Everyone folds to you. What's your action?",
			"scenario": {
				"hero_hand": "As Jd",
				"position": "CO",
				"action_to_hero": "fold_to_hero",
				"stack_depth": "100bb"
			},
			"options": [
				"Fold",
				"Limp",
				"Raise 2.5bb"
			],
			"answer": "Raise 2.5bb",
			"explanation": "AJo is comfortably within the CO opening range. With only the BTN and blinds behind, you have good position and a strong hand. Raising is standard to take initiative and build the pot with a hand that has good equity."
		},
		{
			"id": "pf_005",
			"type": "preflop_action",
			"difficulty": "beginner",
			"topic": "preflop",
			"question": "You're in the SB with KQo. BTN raises to 2.5bb. What's your action?",
			"scenario": {
				"hero_hand": "Ks Qd",
				"position": "SB",
				"action_to_hero": "raise_2.5bb",
				"stack_depth": "100bb"
			},
			"options": [
				"Fold",
				"Call",
				"3-bet to 10bb"
			],
			"answer": "3-bet to 10bb",
			"explanation": "KQo is a strong hand that should be 3-bet from the SB against a BTN open. The BTN has a wide opening range, and 3-betting allows you to take initiative and avoid playing out of position with a capped range. A slightly larger sizing (4x) is used from out of position."
		},
		{
			"id": "pf_006",
			"type": "preflop_action",
			"difficulty": "intermediate",
			"topic": "preflop",
			"question": "You're in the BB with 87s. CO raises to 2.5bb, BTN calls. What's your action?",
			"scenario": {
				"hero_hand": "8s 7s",
				"position": "BB",
				"action_to_hero": "raise_and_call",
				"stack_depth": "100bb",
				"pot_odds": "getting 4.5:1"
			},
			"options": [
				"Fold",
				"Call",
				"3-bet to 12bb"
			],
			"answer": "Call",
			"explanation": "87s is a suited connector with excellent implied odds in multiway pots. You're getting a favorable price (closing the action with good pot odds) and can realize equity well. 3-betting would be too aggressive with this speculative hand, and folding wastes the pot odds you're receiving."
		},
		{
			"id": "pf_007",
			"type": "preflop_action",
			"difficulty": "intermediate",
			"topic": "preflop",
			"question": "You're on the BTN with A5s. UTG raises to 3bb. What's your action?",
			"scenario": {
				"hero_hand": "As 5s",
				"position": "BTN",
				"action_to_hero": "raise_3bb",
				"stack_depth": "100bb"
			},
			"options": [
				"Fold",
				"Call",
				"3-bet to 9bb"
			],
			"answer": "3-bet to 9bb",
			"explanation": "A5s is a polarized 3-bet candidate from the BTN. It has ace blockers (reducing the likelihood villain has AA/AK), can make the nut flush, and has wheel potential. This hand is too weak to call but strong enough to 3-bet as a bluff with good postflop playability."
		},
		{
			"id": "pf_008",
			"type": "preflop_action",
			"difficulty": "intermediate",
			"topic": "preflop",
			"question": "You're in the SB with JTs. BTN raises to 2.5bb. What's your action?",
			"scenario": {
				"hero_hand": "Js Ts",
				"position": "SB",
				"action_to_hero": "raise_2.5bb",
				"stack_depth": "100bb"
			},
			"options": [
				"Fold",
				"Call",
				"3-bet to 10bb"
			],
			"answer": "3-bet to 10bb",
			"explanation": "JTs should be 3-bet from the SB against a BTN open. Calling creates a capped range out of position, while 3-betting allows you to take initiative with a hand that has strong postflop equity. This hand can make straights, flushes, and strong top pairs."
		},
		{
			"id": "pf_009",
			"type": "preflop_action",
			"difficulty": "intermediate",
			"topic": "preflop",
			"question": "You're in the BB with QJo. UTG raises to 3bb, MP calls. What's your action?",
			"scenario": {
				"hero_hand": "Qs Jd",
				"position": "BB",
				"action_to_hero": "raise_and_call",
				"stack_depth": "100bb"
			},
			"options": [
				"Fold",
				"Call",
				"3-bet to 15bb"
			],
			"answer": "Fold",
			"explanation": "QJo is a marginal hand facing an UTG raise and a call. You're out of position against two players with strong ranges. QJo doesn't play well multiway and is dominated by many hands in their ranges (AQ, KQ, QQ, JJ). The pot odds aren't sufficient to overcome the positional and equity disadvantages."
		},
		{
			"id": "pf_010",
			"type": "preflop_action",
			"difficulty": "advanced",
			"topic": "preflop",
			"question": "You're in the SB with A4s. BTN raises to 2.5bb. What's your action?",
			"scenario": {
				"hero_hand": "As 4s",
				"position": "SB",
				"action_to_hero": "raise_2.5bb",
				"stack_depth": "100bb"
			},
			"options": [
				"Fold",
				"Call",
				"3-bet to 10bb"
			],
			"answer": "3-bet to 10bb",
			"explanation": "A4s is a premium 3-bet bluff from the SB versus BTN. It has strong ace blockers, nut flush potential, and wheel possibilities. Calling would leave you out of position with a capped range, while 3-betting allows you to win the pot immediately or play for stacks with good equity when called."
		},
		{
			"id": "pf_011",
			"type": "preflop_action",
			"difficulty": "advanced",
			"topic": "preflop",
			"question": "You're in BB with K9s. SB raises to 3bb (heads up). What's your action?",
			"scenario": {
				"hero_hand": "Ks 9s",
				"position": "BB",
				"action_to_hero": "sb_raise_3bb",
				"stack_depth": "100bb"
			},
			"options": [
				"Fold",
				"Call",
				"3-bet to 9bb"
			],
			"answer": "3-bet to 9bb",
			"explanation": "In blind versus blind situations, ranges are significantly wider. K9s is strong enough to 3-bet for value against the SB's wide opening range. This hand has good equity, can make strong pairs and flushes, and 3-betting allows you to take control of the pot."
		},
		{
			"id": "pf_012",
			"type": "preflop_action",
			"difficulty": "advanced",
			"topic": "preflop",
			"question": "You're UTG with 99. What's your action?",
			"scenario": {
				"hero_hand": "9h 9d",
				"position": "UTG",
				"action_to_hero": "first_to_act",
				"stack_depth": "100bb"
			},
			"options": [
				"Fold",
				"Limp",
				"Raise 2.5bb"
			],
			"answer": "Raise 2.5bb",
			"explanation": "99 is at the bottom of most UTG opening ranges but should still be opened. It's a strong pocket pair that has good equity against most hands and can win large pots when it improves or holds up. Folding would be too tight, and limping invites multiway pots where your hand value decreases."
		},
		{
			"id": "rng_001",
			"type": "range_check",
			"difficulty": "beginner",
			"topic": "ranges",
			"question": "Is QQ in UTG's opening range?",
			"scenario": {
				"hand": "QQ",
				"position": "UTG",
				"action": "open"
			},
			"options": [
				"Yes",
				"No"
			],
			"answer": "Yes",
			"explanation": "QQ is a premium pocket pair and is always in every position's opening range. UTG typically opens all pocket pairs 99+ along with strong broadway hands and suited connectors down to about 65s."
		},
		{
			"id": "rng_002",
			"type": "range_check",
			"difficulty": "beginner",
			"topic": "ranges",
			"question": "Is 65s in UTG's opening range?",
			"scenario": {
				"hand": "65s",
				"position": "UTG",
				"action": "open"
			},
			"options": [
				"Yes",
				"No"
			],
			"answer": "No",
			"explanation": "65s is too speculative for UTG. While suited connectors have playability, they need position and favorable pot odds to be profitable. UTG's range is tight (roughly 12-15% of hands), and 65s doesn't make the cut. This hand becomes profitable from HJ/CO onwards."
		},
		{
			"id": "rng_003",
			"type": "range_check",
			"difficulty": "beginner",
			"topic": "ranges",
			"question": "Is AKo in BTN's opening range?",
			"scenario": {
				"hand": "AKo",
				"position": "BTN",
				"action": "open"
			},
			"options": [
				"Yes",
				"No"
			],
			"answer": "Yes",
			"explanation": "AKo is a premium hand that's in every position's opening range. The BTN has the widest opening range (approximately 45-50% of hands) due to positional advantage, and AKo is near the top of that range."
		},
		{
			"id": "rng_004",
			"type": "range_check",
			"difficulty": "beginner",
			"topic": "ranges",
			"question": "Is 22 in UTG's opening range?",
			"scenario": {
				"hand": "22",
				"position": "UTG",
				"action": "open"
			},
			"options": [
				"Yes",
				"No"
			],
			"answer": "No",
			"explanation": "Small pocket pairs like 22 are generally not in UTG's opening range. While some aggressive players might include them, standard UTG ranges start at 99 or 88 at the loosest. Small pairs need implied odds and position to be profitable, which UTG lacks."
		},
		{
			"id": "rng_005",
			"type": "range_check",
			"difficulty": "intermediate",
			"topic": "ranges",
			"question": "Is A5s in BTN's 3-bet range vs CO?",
			"scenario": {
				"hand": "A5s",
				"position": "BTN",
				"action": "3bet_vs_CO"
			},
			"options": [
				"Yes",
				"No"
			],
			"answer": "Yes",
			"explanation": "A5s is a standard 3-bet bluff from BTN versus CO. It has ace blockers (reducing AA/AK combos), nut flush potential, and wheel straight possibilities. It's too weak to call but has enough equity and playability to 3-bet profitably."
		},
		{
			"id": "rng_006",
			"type": "range_check",
			"difficulty": "intermediate",
			"topic": "ranges",
			"question": "Is KJo in UTG's opening range?",
			"scenario": {
				"hand": "KJo",
				"position": "UTG",
				"action": "open"
			},
			"options": [
				"Yes",
				"No"
			],
			"answer": "No",
			"explanation": "KJo is not in UTG's opening range. While it's a broadway hand, it's dominated by too many hands in opponents' ranges (AK, AJ, KQ) and doesn't play well out of position. UTG typically only opens KQo+ among offsuit broadway combinations."
		},
		{
			"id": "rng_007",
			"type": "range_check",
			"difficulty": "intermediate",
			"topic": "ranges",
			"question": "Is 98s in HJ's opening range?",
			"scenario": {
				"hand": "98s",
				"position": "HJ",
				"action": "open"
			},
			"options": [
				"Yes",
				"No"
			],
			"answer": "Yes",
			"explanation": "98s is a suited connector that's comfortably within HJ's opening range. HJ opens approximately 20-25% of hands, and 98s has good playability with straight and flush potential. It benefits from the improved position compared to early positions."
		},
		{
			"id": "rng_008",
			"type": "range_check",
			"difficulty": "intermediate",
			"topic": "ranges",
			"question": "Is TT in BB's 3-bet range vs UTG?",
			"scenario": {
				"hand": "TT",
				"position": "BB",
				"action": "3bet_vs_UTG"
			},
			"options": [
				"Yes",
				"No"
			],
			"answer": "No",
			"explanation": "TT is typically a call in the BB versus an UTG open, not a 3-bet. BB's 3-bet range versus UTG is polarized and tight, consisting primarily of JJ+, AKs, and AKo for value, plus some bluffs. TT has good equity but is better suited for a calling strategy to realize equity postflop."
		},
		{
			"id": "rng_009",
			"type": "range_check",
			"difficulty": "advanced",
			"topic": "ranges",
			"question": "Is 76s in BTN's 3-bet range vs CO?",
			"scenario": {
				"hand": "76s",
				"position": "BTN",
				"action": "3bet_vs_CO"
			},
			"options": [
				"Yes",
				"No"
			],
			"answer": "Yes",
			"explanation": "76s is included in BTN's polarized 3-bet range versus CO as a bluff. Suited connectors make excellent 3-bet bluffs because they have good postflop playability, can make disguised straights and flushes, and don't block hands that would fold to a 3-bet."
		},
		{
			"id": "rng_010",
			"type": "range_check",
			"difficulty": "advanced",
			"topic": "ranges",
			"question": "Is QJo in MP's opening range?",
			"scenario": {
				"hand": "QJo",
				"position": "MP",
				"action": "open"
			},
			"options": [
				"Yes",
				"No"
			],
			"answer": "No",
			"explanation": "QJo is not in MP's opening range. MP (Middle Position) still has many players to act behind and needs a relatively tight range. QJo is dominated by many hands and doesn't play well out of position. It becomes a profitable open from HJ onwards where ranges widen."
		},
		{
			"id": "rng_011",
			"type": "range_check",
			"difficulty": "advanced",
			"topic": "ranges",
			"question": "Is ATo in CO's opening range?",
			"scenario": {
				"hand": "ATo",
				"position": "CO",
				"action": "open"
			},
			"options": [
				"Yes",
				"No"
			],
			"answer": "Yes",
			"explanation": "ATo is in CO's opening range. CO opens approximately 25-30% of hands, and ATo has sufficient equity and playability from this position. It can make strong top pairs and has good card removal effects against 3-betting ranges."
		},
		{
			"id": "rng_012",
			"type": "range_check",
			"difficulty": "advanced",
			"topic": "ranges",
			"question": "Is K7s in SB's 3-bet range vs BTN?",
			"scenario": {
				"hand": "K7s",
				"position": "SB",
				"action": "3bet_vs_BTN"
			},
			"options": [
				"Yes",
				"No"
			],
			"answer": "Yes",
			"explanation": "K7s is in SB's 3-bet range versus BTN as a bluff. Against BTN's wide opening range (40-50%), SB needs to defend aggressively. K7s has king blockers, flush potential, and enough equity to 3-bet profitably while avoiding the trap of calling out of position with a weak hand."

			"answer": "Full House",
			"explanation": "You have three Aces (AAA) and the pair of Sevens on the board (77), making a full house\u2014Aces full of Sevens. This is the best possible hand on this board."

			"answer": "Because OOP cannot effectively bet-fold or bet-call against raises",
			"explanation": "OOP in 3-bet pots, you face a dilemma when raised: bet-folding wastes value with good hands, bet-calling builds pots OOP with capped ranges. Checking transfers initiative to IP but lets you check-raise strong hands and check-call draws, playing more effectively despite positional disadvantage."
